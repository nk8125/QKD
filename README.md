# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Project

## Overview

This project explores the integration of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 encryption with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to establish secure communication channels. The objective is to develop an end-to-end secure communication system resistant to modern threats.

## Methodology

- Encrypt plaintext using AES 256 to generate ciphertext.
- Transfer the encryption key using various QKD protocols.
- Decrypt the ciphertext using AES to retrieve the original plaintext.
- Evaluate the efficacy and security of the integrated system.
